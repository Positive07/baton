# Baton
**Baton** is an input library for LÖVE that bridges the gap between keyboard and gamepad controls and allows you to easily define and change controls on the fly.

```lua
local baton = require 'baton'

local input = baton.new {
  controls = {
    left = {'key:left', 'axis:leftx-', 'button:dpleft'},
    right = {'key:right', 'axis:leftx+', 'button:dpright'},
    up = {'key:up', 'axis:lefty-', 'button:dpup'},
    down = {'key:down', 'axis:lefty+', 'button:dpdown'},
    action = {'key:x', 'button:a'},
  },
  pairs = {
    move = {'left', 'right', 'up', 'down'}
  },
  joystick = love.joystick.getJoysticks()[1],
}

function love.update(dt)
  input:update()

  local x, y = input:get 'move'
  playerShip:move(x*100, y*100)
  if input:pressed 'action' then
    playerShip:shoot()
  end
end
```

## Installation
To use Baton, place `baton.lua` in your project, and then add this code to your `main.lua`:
```lua
baton = require 'baton' -- if your baton.lua is in the root directory
baton = require 'path.to.baton' -- if it's in subfolders
```

## Usage

### Defining controls
Controls are defined using a table. Each key should be the name of a control, and each value should be another table. This table contains strings defining what sources should be mapped to the control. For example, this table
```lua
controls = {
  left = {'key:left', 'axis:leftx-'}
  shoot = {'key:x', 'button:a'}
}
```
will create a control called "left" that responds to the left arrow key and pushing the left analog stick on the controller to the left, and a control called "shoot" that responds to the X key on the keyboard and the A button on the gamepad.

Sources are strings with the following format:
```lua
'[input type]:[input source]'
```
Here are the different input types and the sources that can be associated with them:

| Type    | Description                  | Source                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------| -----------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `key`   | A keyboard key.              | Any LÖVE [KeyConstant](http://love2d.org/wiki/KeyConstant)                                                                                                              |
| `sc`    | A scancode.                  | Any LÖVE [KeyConstant](http://love2d.org/wiki/KeyConstant)                                                                                                              |
| `mouse` | A mouse button.              | A number representing a mouse button (see [love.mouse.isDown](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.mouse.isDown))                                                               |
| `axis`  | A joystick or gamepad axis.  | Either a number representing a joystick axis or a LÖVE [GamepadAxis](http://love2d.org/wiki/GamepadAxis). Add a '+' or '-' on the end to denote the direction to detect.|
| `button`| A joystick or gamepad button.| Either a number repesenting a joystick button or a LÖVE [GamepadButton](http://love2d.org/wiki/GamepadButton)                                                           |
| `hat`   | A joystick hat. | A number representing a joystick hat and a [JoystickHat](https://love2d.org/wiki/JoystickHat). For example '1r' corresponds to the 1st hat pushed right. |

### Defining axis pairs
Baton allows you to define **axis pairs**, which group four controls under a single name. This is perfect for analog sticks, arrow keys, etc., as it allows you to get x and y components quickly.  Each pair is defined by a table with the names of the four controls (in the order left, right, up, down).
```lua
pairs = {
  move = {'moveLeft', 'moveRight', 'moveUp', 'moveDown'},
  aim = {'aimLeft', 'aimRight', 'aimUp', 'aimDown'},
}
```

### Players
**Players** are the objects that monitor and manage inputs.

#### Creating players
To create a player, use `baton.new`:
```lua
player = baton.new(options)
```
`options` is a table containing the following values:
- `controls` - a table of controls
- `pairs` - a table of axis pairs (optional)
- `joystick` - a LÖVE joystick (returned from `love.joystick.getJoysticks`). The `joystick` argument is optional; if it's not specified, or if the joystick becomes unavailable later, the player object will just ignore controller inputs.

#### Updating players
You should update each player each frame by calling this function:
```lua
player:update()
```

#### Getting the value of controls
To get the value of a control, use:
```lua
value = player:get(control)
```
For example, for the controls defined above, we could get the value of the "left" control by doing
```lua
left = player:get 'left'
```
`player:get` always returns a number between 0 and 1, and as such, it is most applicable to controls that act as axes, such as movement controls. To get the value of a control without applying the deadzone, use `player:getRaw`.

#### Getting the value of axis pairs
`player.get` can also get the x and y components of an axis pair.
```lua
x, y = player:get(pair)
```
In this case, `x` and `y` are numbers between -1 and 1. The length of the vector x, y is capped to 1. `player.getRaw` will return the value of axis pairs without deadzone applied.

#### Getting down, pressed, and released states
To see whether a control is currently "held down", use:
```lua
down = player:down(control)
```
`player:down` returns `true` if the value of the control is greater than the deadzone, and `false` if not.

```lua
pressed = player:pressed(control)
```
`player:pressed` return `true` if the control was pressed this `frame`, and false if not.

```lua
released = player:released(control)
```
`player:released` return `true` if the control was released this `frame`, and false if not.

These functions are most applicable for controls that act as buttons, such as a shoot button. That being said, they can be used for any control, which is useful if you want to, for example, use a movement control as a discrete button press to operate a menu.

#### Changing controls
At any time, you can change the sources for a player's controls by modifying the controls table, which can be accessed via `player.config.controls`.

**Note**: removing a control entirely (by running `player.config.controls.left = nil`, for example) will cause errors. If you want to disable a control, you can set it to an empty table, thus removing all of the sources. Also note that the player object cannot detect if new controls are added.

#### Changing the deadzone
You can change the deadzone of a player by setting `player.config.deadzone` to a number between `0` and `1`. The deadzone is set to `0.5` by default. If you set `player.config.squareDeadzone` to `true`, axis pairs will apply deadzone individually to each axis.

#### Reassigning joysticks
If you need to change the joystick associated with a player, just set `player.config.joystick` (which is just a standard LÖVE [Joystick](https://love2d.org/wiki/Joystick) object).

#### Getting the active input device
At any time, only the keyboard/mouse sources or the gamepad sources for a player will be active. A device will be considered active if any of the sources for that device exceed the deadzone. The keyboard and mouse will always take precedence over the gamepad.

You can call `player:getActiveDevice()` to see which input device is currently active. It will return either `'keyboard'` or `'joystick'` (or `nil` if no sources have been used yet). This is useful if you need to change what you display on screen based on the controls the player is using (such as instructions).

**Note:** mouse sources are counted under `keyboard`.

## Contributing
This library is still fairly young, so feel free to take it for a spin and suggest additions and changes (especially if you try making a multiplayer game with it!). Issues and pull requests are always welcome. To run the test, run `love .` in the baton folder.
